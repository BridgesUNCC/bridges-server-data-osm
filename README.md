# osm-bridges-server
Repository for the backend processing and handling of OSM data requests for the BRIDGES project

## Setup
Create a python 3.8 virtual environment. It works also with a 3.6
environment. But likely not a 3.10 environment and further. And reset
the pip packages in the environment from `requirements.txt`.

```bash
$ /opt/python-3.8.10/bin/python3 -m venv myvenv
$ . ./myvenv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Launching Flask Server

(Assuming you have activated the environment first. )

Step 1: To launch the flask server first compile the web server
```bash
$ export FLASK_APP=run.py
```

Step 2: Launch the web server 
```bash
$ flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080
```
--host signifies that the server should use its default IP when listening for requests

--port is the port that it is listening on, the server will be listening on port 8080, unless the server configuration for 8080 redirects to port 80


## Making Queries
To make queries with the server you require two pieces of information, first the bounding box (or city, state) of the area you want returned, and second the filter parameter you want. The both queries can either take in a bounding box of cordinates or a city name and state. 
* Bounding Box
  * minLon
  * minLat
  * maxLon
  * maxLat

* City, State
  * City, State
  
### Map Queries

Map with Bounding Box
```
http://cci-bridges-osm.uncc.edu/coords?minLon=-80.5&minLat=35&maxLon=-80&maxLat=35.5&level=default
```

Map with City Name
```
http://cci-bridges-osm.uncc.edu/loc?location=Chicago, Illinois&level=default
```
To view a list of possible cities visit and the format they should be in visit
[City List](http://cci-bridges-osm.uncc.edu/cities)

* Possible Filtering Values
  * motorway
  * trunk (includes the above too)
  * primary (includes the above too)
  * secondary (includes the above too)
  * tertiary (includes the above too)
  * unclassified (includes the above too)
  * residential (includes the above too)
  * living_street (includes the above too)
  * service (includes the above too)
  * trails
  * walking (includes trails)
  * bicycle (includes tertiary, unclassified, residential and living_street)

If no filter value is given a default value will be used, this default is equivalent to 'unclassified'

### Amenity Queries

Query with Bounding Box
```
http://cci-bridges-osm.uncc.edu/amenity?minLon=-80.5&minLat=35&maxLon=-80&maxLat=35.5&amenity=food
```
Query with City, State
```
http://cci-bridges-osm.uncc.edu/amenity?location=Chicago,%20Illinois&amenity=food
```
*(Note) The '%20' is used to represent a space*

* Possible Filtering Values
  * food
  * school
  * firestation
  * airport
  * heli
